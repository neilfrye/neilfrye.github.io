Running a global professional services organization isn't just about checking boxes - it's about building a strategic engine that drives customer success and sustainable growth. At Stripe, I had the unique opportunity to lead a global Strategy & Operations team across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Each region came with its own challenges, but I thrive in environments where I can step back to see the macro picture and then drill into the details.

## Seeing the Macro to Drive Micro Execution

When hundreds of millions of dollars are on the line, a one-size-fits-all approach won't cut it. Instead, professional services leaders need to blend data with intuition. My approach at Stripe was straightforward:

- **Build a framework** that integrates operational metrics with the flexibility to address regional nuances
- **Use integrated tools** to track everything from consultant utilization to project margins
- **Create a single source of truth** to keep global teams aligned and agile

> "A professional services organization must be proactive, not reactive. The ability to see around corners and anticipate challenges is what separates high-performing teams from those constantly playing catch-up."

## Best Practices Rooted in Real-World Experience

My journey in professional services began long before Stripe. With over 500 client implementations under my belt, I've learned what works and what doesn't.

### 1. Standardization Without Stifling Innovation

The key to scaling professional services is creating structure without rigidity:

- **Pre-defined service packages** help accelerate time-to-value for customers
- **Project governance frameworks** ensure repeatable success while allowing for customization where it matters
- **Robust methodologies** drive profitability without adding friction to the customer journey

In the SaaS world, where customer churn is a constant threat, ensuring a smooth, value-driven implementation isn't optional - it's essential.

## Aligning for Success: The People & Process Equation

Your professional services team should never feel like they are building the plane while flying it. This is where a dedicated Strategy & Operations team makes all the difference.

At Stripe, our global Strategy & Ops team was the backbone that allowed professional services leaders to focus on delivering exceptional customer experiences. This meant:

- **Tight integration** with sales, customer success, and product teams
- **Operational heavy lifting** - tracking KPIs, fine-tuning processes, and ensuring org-wide alignment
- **Focus on key metrics** like utilization, project margins, and time-to-value

> "A high-performing professional services function isn't just about execution - it's about alignment. When people and processes work in sync, customer success follows."

## Data-Driven Leadership: Making Decisions with Confidence

Every decision we made was backed by data. We didn't just set ambitious targets - we measured progress every step of the way.

- **Aligning the sales pipeline** with resource capacity to prevent overcommitment
- **Deep dives into project performance data** to optimize execution
- **Utilization and margin tracking** to ensure long-term profitability

In professional services, every percentage point in utilization or margin directly impacts the bottom line. With a disciplined, data-driven approach, we were able to scale operations strategically, drive immediate impact, and ensure sustainable long-term growth.

## The Takeaway

A high-performing professional services organization is built on three pillars:

1. **Strategic alignment** - ensuring the team's objectives align with broader company goals
2. **Operational excellence** - standardizing processes while allowing flexibility for innovation
3. **Cross-functional collaboration** - integrating seamlessly with sales, customer success, and product teams

When these elements come together, professional services become a strategic asset - not just a cost center.

> "For any SaaS executive or strategy professional, the message is clear: invest in a dedicated Strategy & Ops function for your professional services team, and you'll be better equipped to drive customer success, improve retention, and fuel sustainable growth."
